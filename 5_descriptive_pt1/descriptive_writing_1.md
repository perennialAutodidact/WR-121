Wind-whipped ocean spray roadside motel room lost in time. Sunrise alarm clock
rouses sand-crusted eyelids. Sea foam paint peeling in the thick, briny air.
Roll out of bed. Slide down the dunes and out the door. Sand between the toes
is the least of one's concerns. The finely-ground crystals, infinitesimal specs
of Earth, radiate the same ancient soul they've possessed since the star dust
settled so long ago. Billions of years, waiting patiently to form the footpath
leading to this morning's continental breakfast. Turn left and walk down the
beach to the self-serve waffle station. Turn right for orange juice and stale
cereal. Walk straight on 'til dawn to return to the silent depths from which
life sprang. Wave after wave of frothy truth lapping the toes, reminding the
lungs to inhale, exhale. Pull in the salty breeze and remember what it's like
to be a cosmic blip, tiny and infinite.
