# Persuasive Essay

## Thesis

The solution to homelessness is to give people houses. 

## In Favor
### Cheaper per person than jailing, even with record high average rent prices in
  the USA.
Rent: $2,002/mo * 12 months = $24,024 per person per year
Jail: $39,158 per person per year

Total yearly savings of $7.5 billion

Difference of more than $15k is enough to cover drug rehabilitation services
which cost, on average, $13k per person.

million vacant housing units in the US. The homeless population in 2020 was
around 580,000. This means that in 2020, there were 27 vacant units per
homeless person in the US.

### Moral and ethical imperative

## In Opposition
- People don't want drug addicts living in their neighborhood.
  - The average cost of drug addiction treatment per person in the US is just
    over $13k, which means that the amount of money saved by housing someone vs
    putting them in jail would cover the cost of their addiction treatment,
    potentially with more to spare.
- Generalized vitriol toward homeless people.
  - People are afraid of queues of people waiting for affordable housing
    availabilities overflowing on the streets and causing hazardous conditions
    for their children.
  - People dehumanize the homeless because they view them as a blight on
    society. They waste tax money, endanger 'normal' people and have been
    conditioned to expect help because they receive help.
  - Homelessness is a motivator for people to make something happen for
    themselves and if they don't or aren't able to do it, then they aren't
    worth our time or effort.
